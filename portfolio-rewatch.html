                                    <h3>Fictive background</h3>
                                    <p>With Scandinavian design and manufacturing, the watch brand ReWatch will
                                        establish itself on the market. The company has decided to only sell the watches
                                        online. The target group is the environmentally conscious and design enthusiast
                                        who would like to buy remade products. The watches are made of 75-100%
                                        recyclable material and spare parts. Each watch is unique depending on the
                                        availability of parts from which they are assembled.</p>
                                    <p>ReWatch combines sustainability with an elaborate design that makes it something
                                        of a statement about sustainable development rather than just an accessory that
                                        shows the times. It is a watch that will communicate the personality of the
                                        owner in the form of environmental awareness. They have come so far that the
                                        watches have been produced on a smaller scale and will now start being marketed
                                        online and with the opportunity to also buy them.</p>
                                    <br>

                                    <h3>Responsive web - desktop</h3>
                                    <h6>Rule of 12</h6>
                                    <p>I have chosen to develop a graphic design for a simpler landing page with quite a
                                        lot of air, where you can briefly see what the company does and stands for. The
                                        layout follows the rule of 12 to make it easier to align components and other
                                        elements. In the header you can go to the pages you want, see your statistics on
                                        the shopping cart, log in as a customer and contact customer service.</p>
                                    <p>The hero conveys a strong message about recycling and a unique product where a clear
                                        CTA takes you to e-commerce. Furthermore, a short and concise introduction to
                                        the company and its message follows. To the right I have placed a "sticky" help
                                        button that follows the user through the scrolling. During the intro text, I
                                        have added the features block where the user is attracted (if you want) to see
                                        more of the products, the way ReWatch works and the core of service and the
                                        company.</p>
                                    <p>Finally, there is a footer at the bottom of the page where the user can get a
                                        quick overview of the website.</p>
                                    <div class="post-thumbnils">
                                        <img src="portfolio/rewatch/responsivewebdesktop.jpg" alt="#">
                                    </div>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>

                                    <h3>Responsive web - mobile</h3>
                                    <h6>Rule of 4</h6>
                                    <p>The mobile variant follows the desktop layout and has the same clean style. This
                                        is made possible by the fact that I have adhered to the 4 column rule, which can
                                        be easily applied when the desktop lives on the rule of 12. I have chosen to
                                        place all longer text left due to increased readability, further down at
                                        features and footer the text is centered for faster scanning of the content.</p>
                                    <div class="post-thumbnils">
                                        <img src="portfolio/rewatch/responsivewebmobile.jpg" alt="#">
                                    </div>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3>Graphic concept / guidelines</h3>
                                    <p>I have chosen to focus on a modern and simple style when it comes to logos,
                                        colors and fonts. The logo is a mix of a symbol and wordmark, and represents
                                        both the machinery behind the bells and the nature the company preserves.
                                        Wordmark is shaped in italics (italic) which gives the impression that things
                                        are moving and creating progress. I have also produced an inverted logo that is
                                        suitable for dark backgrounds.</p>
                                    <p>The fonts are unpretentious and easy to read. Bold body text has a line height of
                                        149% and regular body text has a line height of 24px, for increased readability.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The color palette is relatively simple. I have chosen to go for exclusively a
                                        matte 87% of black (for increased readability) and white with a earthy orange
                                        (CTA) that breaks with everything else, which also directs the eye to the
                                        product catalog and the help button. I believe that no more color is needed at
                                        the moment as I want to keep the design simple, modern and efficient, which also
                                        represents what the company stands for.</p>
