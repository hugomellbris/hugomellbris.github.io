                                    <p>The project was based on the target group "People who play board games". We would
                                        explore the needs of the target group, validate the need and develop a concept
                                        idea before the design sprint.

                                        We started with a hypothesis and initiated the process of getting to know the
                                        target group.</p>

                                    <h3>The team</h3>
                                    <p>The project group consisted of five UX students and three Java students from the
                                        Stockholm Institute of Technology.

                                        One of the goals of the project was that all UX students would gain insight into
                                        working with the different roles within SCRUM, and this was solved by rotating
                                        the roles every week.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>During the project, we got along very well and over time we worked in a fast and
                                        solution-oriented way where everyone strived for the same intentions and goals.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>

                                    <p><i>“Users need guidance to find a game they want to test”.</i></b></p>
                                    <p>We conducted 6 interviews with people in the target group to investigate whether
                                        your hypothesis was correct or not.</p>
                                    <h6>Results</h6>
                                    <p>The target audience does not need guidance to find games that they want to test.
                                        They know where to find information about games. One problem we identified was
                                        that many have games they do not have time to play as well as games that
                                        "collects dust".</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <h6>Hypothesis 2</h6>
                                    <p><i>“The user wants to exchange or sell some of the games they have at
                                            home.”</i></b></p>
                                    <p>We conducted a questionnaire study where we received 33 answers and performed
                                        three qualitative interviews to investigate whether our second hypothesis was
                                        correct.</p>
                                    <h6>Results</h6>
                                    <p>The survey results showed that the target group has an interest in exchanging or
                                        selling games that they no longer play. We were also able to confirm that they
                                        were positive about using a service where they can exchange or sell games.
                                        During the interviews, the results from the survey were confirmed and we also
                                        received concrete examples of what the target group would value with a game
                                        exchange service.</p>

                                        our interviews, we gained many valuable insights into the need to get rid of
                                        games that the user no longer plays at home. Many also had a strong feeling that
                                        new games were expensive and that they were happy to exchange games with friends
                                        or family.</p>

                                    <p>Based on the target group and their needs, we started an idea phase to
                                        investigate as many alternative solutions as possible. To involve the developers
                                        and give them an early understanding of the user, they were involved in the idea
                                        generation. With the exercise "The Problem Generation Process" we explored many
                                        alternatives to solutions. The challenge was to develop the solution that will
                                        work as an MVP and best meet the user's needs.

                                    <p>To get an idea of ​​the service's structure and flow for the user, we created a
                                        note-n-map. We started from the needs and developed a possible flow for the
                                        service.</p>

                                    <h3>Crazy 8</h3>
                                    <p>When it was time to start exploring possible solutions to what the service would
                                        look like and work visually, conducted a Crazy 8 exercise to start the
                                        brainstorming. We realized that we had a relatively common view on the main
                                        functions page and we came up with some unexpected suggestions.</p>
                                    <br>

                                    <h3>Story mapping</h3>
                                    <p>To concretize the service and begin the work of limiting the service to an MVP,
                                        we created a comprehensive story map to start from. We started by "dreaming big"
                                        and wrote down everything we wanted to include in the service.</p>
                                    <p>Then we started to scale down the number of selected tickets in Jira to get a
                                        basis to design from the outside. Selected tickets are marked in green.</p>

                                    <p>We developed a customer journey to give us and the developers a better
                                        understanding of the user's condition during the various parts of the process.
                                        The customer journey provided value for us prior to the design work in that we
                                        could see what critical elements there were for the user.</p>

                                    <p>The last thing we did before we started sketching our prototype was to develop a
                                        sitemap to know what pages and views would be needed to make a complete
                                        prototype. During the work, we could return to our sitemap and see what would be
                                        done here next.</p>

                                    <p>We performed four remote usability tests to evaluate the prototype. The tests
                                        were based on a scenario followed by a post-interview. After the first tests, we
                                        gained several valuable insights into the second iteration of the prototype.</p>

                                        valuable insights for us was that the flow was experienced clearly and smoothly.
                                        The test subjects appreciated the limited amount of information and understood

                                        as a basis. Our two most important points in the creative brief were "insight"
                                        and "tonality".</p>

                                    <p>Playful and reassuring: We need to meet the target group with a positive and
                                        trusting tone to encourage game swaps and get users to keep a good tone towards

                                    <p>With the logo and the name, we wanted to highlight the playfulness of the service
                                        and connect it to the board game culture. The tower symbolizes the meeting place

                                    <p>We use active and clear colors that give an optimistic and playful atmosphere to
                                        the service. The dark blue main color instills confidence and stability that we

                                    <h3>Minimum Viable Product</h3>
                                    <p>It was time to include the developers and start the sprint weeks. To limit
                                        ourselves and prioritize the right functions, we developed an MVP with a focus
                                        on the most centered function: Find board games and contact the swapper. We
                                        created user stories for the MVP and together with the developers, we set up a
                                        plan for the first week.</p>

                                    <h6>User stories</h6>
                                    <p>Before each week, the Product Owner produced user stories and subtasks in Jira
                                        for good structure. Together with the developers, we used poker planning to make
                                        storypoints for each user story. During the week we had daily standups to make
                                        sure that everyone always knew what their daily tasks were.</p>
                                    <h6>Hi-fi wireframes</h6>
                                    <p>During the week, we worked on producing Hi-fi wireframes on the current part of
                                        the prototype. We quickly noticed that we needed to be efficient in our design
                                        work to be able to spend relevant time on usage tests and iterations.</p>
                                    <h6>Usability tests and iteration</h6>
                                    <p>Before we handed over materials to Java to develop, we needed to validate our
                                        developed wireframes. We performed a number of usability tests for each part of
                                        the prototype, which consisted of a scenario followed by a post-interview. After
                                        the usability tests, we iterated our design, tested again, then we could compile
                                        everything for the design document and hand it over to the developers.</p>
                                    <h6>Reflections</h6>
                                    <p>It took a week before we realized the importance of being one step ahead of the
                                        developers each week. We needed to work faster with our wireframes to have time
                                        to test and iterate before handover. It was an educational process and by the
                                        end of the sprint weeks we had developed a sustainable system that worked for
                                        both teams.</p>
                                    <br>

                                    <h3>Final product</h3>
                                    <p>The sprint weeks resulted in a coded prototype ready for advanced usability
                                        tests. We focused on three areas: finding board games, contacting swappers, and
                                        creating advertisements.</p>

                                    <h3>Insights pt.1 </h3>
                                    <p>The process of going from the target group to idea, to design sprint and finally
                                        seven sprint weeks has been instructive. We have been challenged to make active
                                        and motivated decisions to move the work forward. We have had to work with
                                        structure and handover to make the collaboration flow smoothly to the
                                        developers. It has been an educational and stimulating project where we have
                                        developed as UX designers and in various project roles.</p>
                                    <h6>Feedback loop</h6>
                                    <p>During one of the steps in the prototype, we encountered a feedback loop. We had
                                        to iterate several turns before the flow was natural for the user. We had an
                                        idea that the game ads would look like playing cards to be perceived as more
                                        stimulating to click on. We tested several different designs on the cards and
                                        were constantly met by the same response from users: they thought it was fun,
                                        but a bit confusing. After several twists and turns, we chose to make the ads
                                        more "classic" and follow the anchors that other services use. Users now no
                                        longer had any difficulty understanding the content and they quickly moved on to
                                        the next step.</p>

                                    <h3>Insights pt.2 </h3>
                                    <h6>One step forward, two steps back</h6>
                                    <p>During the weeks we often heard from the developers that they had taken a step
                                        forward and two back. For several sprint weeks, the developers had to recode
                                        existing wireframes as several of the site's functions were initially
                                        "hard-coded" and not functional. Therefore, when installing the backend
                                        function, many wireframes needed to be redone from the ground up. We had to be
                                        very patient with each other and in our roles to continue to support each other
                                        even if it did not feel like the prototype was progressing so fast.</p>
                                    <h6>Jira</h6>
                                    <p>Since this was the first time we worked with Jira, it took a while before we all
                                        got a grip on how we wanted to use the program so that it suited us as well as
                                        possible. We tried several different ways to write our user stories and
                                        evaluated these every week. It was also instructive to see how much difference
                                        the actual work became depending on how the preparatory work was set up. In the
                                        weeks when we succeeded well with the line-up, the work flowed more naturally
                                        and there were less question marks about what should be done and by whom.</p>
                                    <br>

                                    <h3>Learnings</h3>
                                    <h6>What has helped us move forward?</h6>
                                    <p>We have had a good willingness to cooperate in the group. Everyone has been
                                        involved and it has been a permissive and humble atmosphere. During the project,
                                        we have used a one-day agenda, which in the long run developed our way of
                                        working faster. We have focused on listening to each other and giving and
                                        receiving feedback, which has been rewarding for us and the project. The
                                        dialogue with the developers has been good and we have had a basic respect for
                                        each other's work.</p>
                                    <h6>What we could have done differently</h6>
                                    <p>In retrospect, we have realized that we should have had closer communication with
                                        the Java developers. The importance of clear and agile communication in
                                        cross-functional teams became clearer with each passing week. We also noticed
                                        that the design system was given a central role in communication with the
                                        developers. Had we redid the project, we would have chosen to focus on a clear design system
                                        at an early stage to avoid misunderstandings and facilitate the design process.</p>
                                        <h6>What we have learned</h6>
                                        <p>Since the start of the project, we have worked in parallel with two courses, "Agile methodology and working methods" and "Visual Design", where we worked in cross-functional teams with student Java developers. We are now familiar with working methods such as SCRUM and Lean UX where we used software such as Figma, Miro and Jira.</p>
